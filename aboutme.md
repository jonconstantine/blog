I live in the North of England, love to travel, and advocate the use of technology to both make our lives easier and improve our planet.

Originally taught myself PHP when I was 14 because I was fed up of repeating code changes (template engines are amazing!) From there I want to college and university and was introduced to the .NET ecosystem and haven't looked back since.

### My story

After developing commercially for nearly 6 years, I was presented with the opportunity to become CTO of an exciting new startup, Asemblr. Going from a senior developer to managing all technical aspects of a fast growing company isn't without its difficulties but the experience continues to be amazing and I wouldn't change it for the world. That was until funding ran out.

I currently work for Deliveroo writing Go micro-services, along with a whole host of other connecting technologies.
